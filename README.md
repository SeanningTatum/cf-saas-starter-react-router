# Welcome to React Router!

A modern, production-ready template for building full-stack React applications using React Router.

## Features

- 🚀 Server-side rendering
- ⚡️ Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- 📦 Asset bundling and optimization
- 🔄 Data loading and mutations
- 🔒 TypeScript by default
- 🎉 TailwindCSS for styling
- 🔐 Better Auth integration
- 🗄️ Drizzle ORM with D1 Database
- 📡 tRPC API
- 📖 [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Authentication Setup

This project uses [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/) for authentication. The authentication secret is stored in `.dev.vars` for local development and has been pre-configured with a secure random value.

For production deployment, set the secret using Wrangler:

```bash
# Generate a new secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Set the secret in Cloudflare
wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
```

The authentication API is available at `/api/auth/*`.

## Previewing the Production Build

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

Deployment is done using the Wrangler CLI.

To build and deploy directly to production:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

To deploy a preview URL:

```sh
npx wrangler versions upload
```

You can then promote a version to production after verification or roll it out progressively.

```sh
npx wrangler versions deploy
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
